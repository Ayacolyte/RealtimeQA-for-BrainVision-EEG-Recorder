# RealtimeQA-for-BrainVision-EEG-Recorder
This project is intended to be used for BrainVision Recorder's EEG measurement kit. It allows real-time quality inspection based on metrics developed by Li Dong (UETSC)'s DRT toolbox.
## Usage
- For testing, run the test.m which contains simulated data to test graphics output
- To deploy in experimental settings, migrate the entire folder to the computer running BrainVision Recorder, enable Remote Data Access (RDA) in the BrainVision Recorder software and run the script RDA.m
